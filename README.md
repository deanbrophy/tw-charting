This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app).

## Getting Started

`yarn` or `npm i` followed by `yarn start` or `npm start`

## What's This About?

Trying to blend [Material UI](Components) with a bit of [Victory Charting](http://formidable.com/open-source/victory/docs/victory-chart/). As well, I had to use [React Virtualized](https://github.com/bvaughn/react-virtualized) to account for changes in chart container size.
